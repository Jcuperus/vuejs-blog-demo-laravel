# Vue blog demo backend
A project I wrote for a bootcamp to teach beginning programmers how to use the laravel framework. This application demonstrates all CRUD operations and lets a user login using a simple token based authentication method. A vue frontend was also provided at https://github.com/Jcuperus/vuejs-blog-demo
